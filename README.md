This example demonstrates a common subtle error in COBOL programs involving the accidental use of a numeric literal where a data field is expected.  The code attempts to initialize a counter and iterate, but the initialization uses a literal value rather than assigning to a data field. This can lead to hard-to-find bugs, especially in larger applications.  The solution demonstrates the correct approach, ensuring that numeric values are properly assigned to data fields.
